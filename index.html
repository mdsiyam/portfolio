					<h3>Web Designer and Developer</h3>
					<p>As a web designer, you'll plan, create and code web pages, using both technical and non-technical skills to produce websites that fit your customers' requirements.</p>
					<p>Being involved in the technical and graphical aspects of pages, you'll determine not only the look of the website but how it works as well. You may also be responsible for the maintenance of an existing site.</p>
					<p>The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is misguided. Web developing is a more specialist role, focusing on the back-end development of a website and will incorporate, among other things, the creation of highly complex search functions.</p>
					<p>The growth in touchscreen phones and tablet devices has dictated a new way of designing websites, with the web designer needing to ensure that web pages are responsive no matter what type of device is being used. Therefore, the need to test websites at different stages of design and on a variety of devices, has become an important aspect of the job.</p>
